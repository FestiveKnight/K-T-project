# K-T-project
-We picked this establishment because it was a free choice that no one else had chosen.

-We picked blue as our theme color because it is my favorite color and my partner also enjoyed the theme color.

-We had chosen the "sunset" background image for our home page because we could not find a suitable shoe image that was the right size so -we instead used a nice, warm, and gentle sunset image.

-We included an all shoes page because it is important to see all of your options as a consumer.

-We made a contact page as our third page because it is important for a buisness to get customer feedback about suggestions.

-We made a brands page because it is important to awknowledge a consumers prefferences in which they may have in brands as a specifacation for which they would need to narrow their choices.

-We also made a sizes page for it would be important that a shoe would specifically fit your foot and to be able to use that to filter your choices.
